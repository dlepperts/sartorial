Welcome to Sartorial!

This runs on Ruby v 2.6.1 and will require the user to: 
- bundle install
- rake db:migrate
- optional: if interested in playing with artificial data, seed the database via:
    - rake db:seed

The purpose of the app is to connect clients and tailors, offering a service for the former to mail articles of clothing and having them altered based on the measurements they enter. 

Enjoy!
